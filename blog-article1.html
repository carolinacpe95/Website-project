                      <p class="mb-30">Before the pandemic, I traveled extensively to various countries, including Colombia, Mexico, and the United States, attending university classes and immersing myself in their respective cultures and languages. There is so much I have learned about people and culture beyond the traditional definition of a workplace that the positive effects of this experience have instilled in me the importance of understanding the wider world. </p>
                      
                        <p class="mb-30">Becoming a global citizen comes with multiple challenges, such as constant adaptation to unfamiliar environments, language barriers, and different norms, beliefs, and behavioral expectations. However, regardless of how difficult this experience may seem, it is ultimately rewarding. Adaptability grants us a competitive edge by enabling us to provide innovative solutions through a wide variety of perspectives while interacting with diverse individuals. I have embarked on numerous trips over the last few years, and I want to emphasize this point: We should live abroad at least once in our lifetime. </p>
                        <p class="mb-30">How do you overcome these challenges and stand out globally? Here are some tips to help you in this amazing journey.

                          <p class="mb-30">•	Embrace cultural diversity: Living abroad has opened my eyes to the richness of different personalities and cultures. During my college experience, I encountered a situation that led to conflict within our team while working on our final project. During a team meeting, I noticed that there were varying communication styles and approaches to decision-making. Also, It became clear that understanding and navigating diverse cultures is, was and will be essential in our global society. Instead of expecting everyone to conform to my own communication style (Very Colombian BTW), I recognized and appreciated the diversity within the team. By embracing those cultural differences, my team and I were able to overcome our challenges, appreciate each other's perspectives, and ultimately deliver a successful project.</p> 
                          
                            <p class="mb-30">•	Overcome your fear of speaking in a second language: using a second language is not as easy as learning it. Although I knew basic English grammar rules, reaching a conversational level was not something that happened overnight. I was so focused on avoiding mistakes while talking that my English skills were not improving. It was until I let go of the need for perfection that I became fluent. </p>
                          
                              <p class="mb-30">• Prepare to wear as many hats as possible to achieve your goals: By being open to diverse opportunities and being willing to explore different roles, industries, and paths, you can broaden your horizons and unlock new possibilities. Don't confine yourself to preconceived notions of what you should or shouldn't do. Instead, be proactive in seeking out experiences that align with your passions and aspirations, even if they may be sound unconventional.</p>
                          
                                <p class="mb-30"> These principles hold true universally, but it is through living life abroad that you can truly master and embody them. </p>
                          </p>
